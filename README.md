# DPhil supporting data and code
Welcome to the repository containing the supporting data and code for the exploratory analysis and visualisations that guided and back up my doctoral research. 

NB: at this stage, it has not been tidied or standardised and is therefore exclusively for examiners' use - I will publish the whole database once it is ready but for the time being, please refrain from using this data.
Thank you!

This material is currently organised by chapter. Each chapter folder contains R files and CSV files. The former correspond to the code for the computations performed in my analysis and the graphs that I have generated. The latter correspond to the datasets. For a more readable view of the data, you can download the CSV files and open them with a spreadsheet editor (e.g. Excel, LibreOffice Calc, OpenOffice Calc, or Google Sheets). Please bear in mind, though, that Excel will automatically format some of the cells, which will result in corrupted data (for certain decimals, which are converted to dates). These errors are produced by the software and are not in the data itself, and they are unavoidable with Excel. It should still provide a good overview of the dataset, but if you would like consistently accurate numbers, use LibreOffice Calc instead (the character encoding is UTF-8 and separators are semicolons). IMPORTANT: if you would like to run the code (see below), do not open the CSV file in Excel at all.

If you would like to run the R scripts, you will need to download R (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and install it, then download and install RStudio (https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). A good tutorial can be found here: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
