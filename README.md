# DPhil supporting data and code
Welcome to the repository containing the supporting data and code for the exploratory analysis and visualisations that guided and back up my doctoral research. 
This material is currently organised by chapter. At this stage, it has not been tidied or standardised and is therefore exclusively for the use of the examiners - I will publish the whole database once it is ready but for the time being, please refrain from using this data.
Thank you!
