# DPhil supporting data and code
Welcome to the repository containing the supporting data and code for the exploratory analysis and visualisations that guided and back up my doctoral research. 
NB: at this stage, it has not been tidied or standardised and is therefore exclusively for the use of the examiners - I will publish the whole database once it is ready but for the time being, please refrain from using this data.
Thank you!

This material is currently organised by chapter. Each chapter folder contains R files and CSV files. The former correspond to the code for the computations performed in my analysis and the graphs that I have generated. The latter correspond to the datasets. For a more readable view of the data, you can download the CSV files and open them with a spreadsheet editor (e.g. Excel, LibreOffice Calc, OpenOffice Calc, or Google Sheets).
