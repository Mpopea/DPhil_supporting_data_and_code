# Chapter 5 - Most publihsed authors in Poetry (1912-1922)

A quick note on the Poetry data: I have taken the data used to produce figure 5.1 from this page https://www.bartleby.com/lit-hub/monroe-harriet/chronological-index/. I have checked a number of issues selected at random against the indexes published on the Poetry website (https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/archive) and have found them consistent.
While the general quality of the data appears to be good, I have found, by coincidence, a group of poems that were not included in the list. Those are Hilda Conkling's poems in issue 16.4 (July 1920), which I have added manually, as they do place Hilda Conkling within the 95th percentile.

I have then computed a count of the number of pieces per author - translations were not considered as part of the count.

While I made sure that the data was clean enough to produce meaningful, definite results when generating figure 5.1 as it appears in my appendix, I have since gone over the data and done another round of cleaning (as some names appear with different spellings, etc.)
This has confirmed my initial results - the only difference is that Helen Louise Birch is now among the 93rd percentile, and Yvor Winters is ranked higher than previously, which does not change my conclusions in any way.
